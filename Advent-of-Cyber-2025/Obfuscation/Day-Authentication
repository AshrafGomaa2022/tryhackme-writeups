# Authentication Basics – Advent of Cyber 2025

## Overview
This challenge focused on understanding authentication
mechanisms used in web applications.

## Security Concept
Authentication verifies user identity, while sessions
maintain user state after login.

## What Was Done
- Reviewed how login and session handling worked
- Observed weak or insecure behavior
- Analyzed authentication logic

## Tools Used
- Web browser
- Application interface

## Outcome
The challenge demonstrated how weak authentication
can lead to account-related risks.

## Key Takeaways
- Authentication is a common attack target
- Session handling must be implemented securely
- Logic flaws can be as dangerous as technical flaws
