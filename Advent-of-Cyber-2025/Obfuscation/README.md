# Obfuscation – Advent of Cyber 2025

## Overview
This challenge focuses on understanding basic obfuscation techniques
used to hide data or information. The goal was to identify the encoding
layers and decode them step by step to reveal the original content.

## Challenge Context
Obfuscation is commonly used to make data harder to read or analyze.
It does not change the functionality of the data, but it reduces
readability and slows down analysis.

This challenge helped reinforce the difference between obfuscation
and encryption.

## Tools Used
- CyberChef
- Online decoding tools
- Manual analysis

## Analysis Steps
1. Inspected the provided data and noticed it was not human-readable.
2. Identified common encoding patterns based on character structure.
3. Decoded the data step by step instead of applying multiple techniques at once.
4. Repeated the process until the original message was revealed.

## Result
After decoding all layers, the hidden message was successfully recovered.

## Key Takeaways
- Obfuscation is not encryption.
- Most obfuscation techniques rely on simple, reversible methods.
- Identifying patterns is more important than using many tools.
- Step-by-step analysis leads to better understanding.

## Learning Outcome
This challenge improved my ability to:
- Recognize common encoding formats
- Use decoding tools correctly
- Approach analysis in a structured way
